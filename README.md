This package is used for order management for online shops.

## Collect Order Information
This example uses Google Form to accept order. Form responses are then exported to Google Sheets[^1]. Data is hence extracted using Google Sheets API and transformed.

## Notification and Whatsapp link
Order confirmation notifications based on provided template with emojis are created for each user. Links to Whatsapp which include pre-filed message are created.[^2]
