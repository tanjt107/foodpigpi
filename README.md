[My client](https://www.instagram.com/foodpigpi/ "My client") is an owner of an online store selling Taiwan food. She accepts orders using Google form and she used to spent nearly one day to copy and paste order confirmation messages from a template, to calculate the revenue of every single order. This solution not only automates the jobs above but also consolidates delivery details which saves her time in packing delivery parcels.
